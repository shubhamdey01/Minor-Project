       "\"A bomb technician has used his expertise to create an Easter egg hunt for blind children - using beeping eggs. David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy . The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute. Hyche (pictured) came up with the device when his daughter turned blind nine years ago . The father has shared his idea with the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind (pictured) this year .\""
